 <h1>Personal Reflection 1: 25 Questions</h1>
 <ol>
 <li>Question</li> is design the same/equivalent to 'art?'
 <li>Question</li>am i a designer or an artist?
 <li>Question</li>where does code find its place in artwork?
 <li>Question</li>is coding its own art form?
 <li>Question</li>is code a tool for artists in the same way that ai is?
 <li>Question</li>how moral is generative art as a whole?
 <li>Question</li>if you are using pre generated code from chat gbt etc are you still considered a programmer/coder?
 <li>Question</li>is using auto generated images as refrences, specifically other fine arts works, plagarism?
 <li>Question</li>how indirect can plagarism be?
 <li>Question</li>is it worth it to learn to code fully now because of how monopolizing ai written code will probably become?
 <li>Question</li>how quickly will ai programs replace people who write code or design?
 <li>Question</li>will all designers become 'checkers' for generated art/design instead of the physical designer?
 <li>Question</li>will they remain seperate facets of the same field or will they fully take over and merge with the human side?
 <li>Question</li>if design could be fully overtaken by ai programs, could music?
 <li>Question</li>could painting?
 <li>Question</li>how realistic is ai generated content replacing all or most of the media we comsume? (TV, social media influencers, games etc)
 <li>Question</li> how prevalent is ai generated media that we are unaware of? callback to that michela influencer from a few years ago who was completely digitally created to advertise and sell products to people on social media.
 <li>Question</li> ai has been around for much longer than people realize, how did it become so public so quickly?
 <li>Question</li>why was it so widely accepted by so many people who did not fully understand it?
 <li>Question</li>is it just the guise of something shiny and new?
 <li>Question</li>how does my personal success relate to my understanding of using ai and accepting it in my field?
 <li>Question</li>should i become more versed in ai in order to better succeed?
 <li>Question</li>in every generation of technology, there is a 'new thing' that everyone needs to learn, was typing then coding etc; is ai the new tool now?
 <li>Question</li>beside my hesitation to use generative tools in my personal work, do i really have an issue with ai in professional work? it would help me complete tasks faster and better if its right.
 <li>Question</li> would it be worth the amount of time and effort to get what i want from ai? or would simply creating myself be better at that point?
