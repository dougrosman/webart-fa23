 <h1>Personal Reflection 1: 25 Questions</h1>
 <ol>
 <li>  What kind of job would work well with my interests?
</li>
 <li>  I know I want to make art, but do I need a job directly in a field of art for my practice to continue? </li>
 <li> How can I find an art related job that won’t burn me out of having a personal practice?</li>
 <li> What kind of jobs can I find that facilitate community art making?</li>
 <li>Am I more interested in pursuing a field that is more related to processes and studio maintenance or towards being directly involved in the design aspect?</li>
 <li>Do I even care about making money beyond having my basic necessities met?</li>
 <li> How can I continue collaborating with others as a part of my professional future?</li>
 <li> How can I describe my art practice in one sentence? </li>
 <li>Is my role as an artist directly tied to having the social responsibility of trying to better the world around me through my self expression?
</li>
 <li>How does my experience at SAIC and studying art within an institution implicitly affect my bias and understandings of the world around me?
</li>
 <li>How do my experiences within an institution benefit my understanding of all different types of artists/art making? </li>
 <li>How do those experiences studying within an institution negatively affect my awareness of the other ways people learn through lived experience/make art outside of a formal education?</li>
 <li> How can I continue learning about the world and furthering my knowledge/awareness of the world when I am done being a formal “student”? </li>
 <li>Are there aspects of my learned knowledge I have gained in my education here that I can and should find ways to pass onto others? </li>
 <li>How do I find ways to not become stagnant and uninspired in my art making if that should come up post graduation?</li>
 <li>Do I know professors I could reach out to post graduation to help me find further opportunities? </li>
 <li> Do I want to go to grad school?
</li>
 <li>What would grad school help me with that I can’t access in my undergraduate education /in the outside world post graduation? 
</li>
 <li>Are there ways to study non art fields (such as academic fields/science/etc) without having to go pursue another undergraduate degree /or go to grad school?</li>
 <li>Do I want to stay in Chicago when I’m done with school?</li>
 <li>Would it benefit me more to go directly into pursuing another interest (such as traveling/exploring farm stay options/doing more in world outside of the art bubble) directly after school is over or will that distract me from pursuing a professional career?</li>
 <li>How can I find unique ways to work and budget myself in the next few years without being completely overworked?</li>
 <li>How to factor in free time when working full time and also trying to have an art practice? </li>
 <li>Do I feel ready to graduate in the spring?</li>
 <li>25. Do I feel prepared to do all of the next steps towards graduating at SAIC (do I know about how to set up spring bfa show, checking on my credits, doing capstone in the spring etc)? </li>
